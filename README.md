# Chrome Extension: Time Zone Converter 

## Technologies Used 
* Javascript, HTML/CSS

## Description
I developed and published a chrome extension that converts time between 230+ time zones. The extension also gets the user's local time zone and current time. The default time and time zone to convert from is the user's local time zone and current time, but any time or time zone can be chosen to convert to. On the extension, a message is displayed showing whether the user is currently in a Daylight Savings Time zone or not. The user can also switch a checkbox to hide all Daylight Savings Time Zone options which is default set to true if the user is not in a Daylight Savings Time Zone. 

## Download the Chrome Extension
To download the chrome extension, you can get it from the Chrome Web Store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-zone-converter/haoelibdhbhbcnoekhnbakcjkkfflblm
